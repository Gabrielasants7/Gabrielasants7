Hello, welcome to my profile, my name is Gabriela Rebou√ßas, I'm finishing my graduation in Data Science, I'm a very curious person, and I'm always looking to learn new technological tools, I'm currently very excited about the Kotlin language. with an emphasis on Data Science, besides being passionate about Data Science, I have some basic knowledge in backend and Android development, in the future, I would like to be able to pass on all the knowledge I acquire, making content available for free on the internet.
